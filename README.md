# FileEncryptorwithFernet

This is a complete TUI (Terminal User Interface) designed to help you navigate the file system, point to a to be encrypted/decrypted file and a key file, so you can encrypt or decrypt it using Fernet.

You have standard commands like pwd to show the current working directory, cd to change the cwd, ls to list the files in the cwd, clear to clear the command prompt, and exit to terminate the application.

You can save directories, last used key files, and non operable files extensions to a txt file, so the program will remember them even after you close it.

I am too lazy to explain everything here. Run the python file, and type --help to get a detailed usage explanation.


(WARNING: I built this in windows, so some variables are windows spesific. For example the fixed path for the save file I mentioned earlier will be created in "C:\Users\tomok\OneDrive\Belgeler\". If you are using any other OS than windows, you won't be able to save anything after you close the application so you have to be careful. Other than this, it might also act weird with another OS. Never tried so I don't know.)
