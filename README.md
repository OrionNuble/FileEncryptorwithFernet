# FileEncryptorwithFernet

This is a complete TUI (Terminal User Interface) designed to help you navigate the file system, point to a to be encrypted/decrypted file and a key file, so you can encrypt or decrypt it using Fernet.

You have standard commands like pwd to show the current working directory, cd to change the cwd, ls to list the files in the cwd, clear to clear the command prompt, and exit to terminate the application.

You can save directories, last used key files, and non operable files extensions to a txt file, so the program will remember them even after you close it.

I am too lazy to explain everything here. Run the python file, and type --help to get a detailed usage explanation.
